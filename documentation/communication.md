### General Communication Plan:
Firstly, each group member should be conscious of the need to create an environment where it is safe to share ideas and where everyone gets to speak equally. Each member also realizes as growing and learning team members the importance of practicing creating such an environment. This is just the first of many teams we will work on!

Some particulars to foster a safe environment:
- Checking in with each other regularly on project status AND emotional state.
- Be mindful of interruptions by self or others. Make sure to loop back to people who have been interrupted or politely ask the interrupter to please wait so they can speak.
- Be open to other approaches and donâ€™t be afraid to share ideas.
- Be ok with standing up for your ideas, but also be open to feedback.
- Make sure everyone has a chance to speak and contribute in equal proportions.
- Consciously check every so often to see if an imbalance of talking time or contribution is developing. 
- We will trust each other to pull our weight and be accountable for our own work.
